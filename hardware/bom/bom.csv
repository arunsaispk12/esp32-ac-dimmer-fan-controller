Notes:
- All resistors metal film 1% tolerance unless noted otherwise
- All capacitors rated for at least 2x operating voltage
- X2 capacitor (C3) is safety-critical - DO NOT SUBSTITUTE with non-rated capacitor
- TRIAC must be isolated tab version (BTA16-600B) - non-isolated (BTA16-600) is dangerous
- MOC3021 must be 5000V isolation rating - verify datasheet
- Fuse must be fast-blow type - slow-blow inadequate for safety
- Terminal blocks must be rated for mains voltage (300V+)
- All mains-voltage components must meet safety standards (UL/VDE/CE)

Sourcing Tips:
1. Purchase from authorized distributors (Mouser Digi-Key Farnell Newark) for critical components
2. Generic passive components OK from budget suppliers
3. Avoid counterfeit semiconductors - verify authentic source
4. Buy extra fuses (5-10) for testing and replacement
5. Consider buying components in small quantities first for prototyping

Total Estimated Cost (Single Unit): $18-25 USD
Total Estimated Cost (10 Units): $12-18 USD per unit
Total Estimated Cost (100 Units): $8-12 USD per unit

Alternative Bridge Rectifier:
- Instead of 4× 1N4007 separate diodes use pre-packaged bridge rectifier:
  - Part: DB107 (1A 1000V bridge)
  - Package: DIP-4
  - Cost: $0.20
  - Easier to install less prone to polarity errors

High Power Variant (400W+ loads):
- Replace BTA16-600B with BTA24-600B or BTA41-600B
- Increase fuse to 10A
- Use heavier heatsink (<5°C/W)
- Increase wire gauge to 14 AWG
- Verify all components rated for increased current

60Hz Version:
- No component changes required
- Update firmware: AC_FREQUENCY=60 AC_HALF_PERIOD=8333

Dual Channel Version:
- Duplicate: Q1 U2 R4 R5 R6 C2 C3 HS1 TB2 (TRIAC circuit)
- Add: Second fuse MOV terminal block
- Share: U1 (zero-cross detector)
- Add: Second GPIO on ESP32 for trigger

Safety Stock Recommendations:
- Keep spare fuses (consumable)
- Keep spare TRIAC (can fail)
- Keep spare optocouplers (can fail)
- Keep spare MOV (degrades over time)

Testing Components:
- 40-60W incandescent lamp for initial testing (NOT included in BOM)
- Multimeter CAT III rated
- Oscilloscope (recommended)
- Isolation transformer (recommended)
- Variac (recommended)

Regional Variations:
North America (120V 60Hz):
- MOV: Use 150V rating instead of 275V
- Fuse: Can use 10A for same load power
- All other components identical

Europe/Asia/Australia (240V 50Hz):
- Use components as specified in BOM
- Ensure power cord has appropriate plug for region
- Check local electrical codes for installation requirements
